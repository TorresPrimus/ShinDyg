# ShinDyg

This project utilizes Javascript, c#, asp.net, and n-tier architecture. 

Prereqisites This project was built using:

Visual Studio 2019 - Visual Studio 2019 Community.

Postman - Postman Api Development Environment

Github - Code Repository, Team collaboration, where our project is hosted. Getting Started

There are two ways to obtain the code. You can download the project as a zip file or clone the repository. If you choose to download the zip file you can then expand it in your choosen location. The prefered method of obtaining the project is by using the command-line Git utility. There is a clip-board friendly Git link right next to the download option. That Git link will allow you to clone the repository using the command line. Either way you obtain the project you can either double click on the solution file in the main directory or open it within Visual Studio.

Once you have the project open there are two aspects to this project. There is an API which accessible using the Postman utility or through the launch page in your browser.
You will need to register for an account and a role thrrough the launch page. Through this MVC you can view, delete, edit, and create Events and Venues. Each Event and Venue have a list of information to give detail. Each Venue can also be attached to an Event and is completely customizable.

The console application is a proof of concept that mirrors the MVC structure and allows you to create Events to draw in crowds of people and get the information out to those people. Navigate to the website its deployed to and at that point you can access the databases after registering an account.

The functions available are to view a specific Event and Venue details or all the Event and Venue, add a new Event and Venue, edit any pre-existing Event and Venue information, as well as delete a Event and Venue from the DB with appropriate access.
